# ClockCipheRS

A rust implementation of the [Clock Cipher](https://www.cachesleuth.com/clockcode.html).

# Why?

I made an implementation of this when I was in SHS which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/itsmenewbie03/shs-java-exercises/tree/main/EXPLORE001).
IDK if I would be proud but the younger me used Switch Case xD
